# Social Network API

## User Story

AS A social media startup<br><br>
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database<br><br>
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Description

This is a basic social network API that shows common functionality similar to popular platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. Funcationlity includes creating/updating/deleting users and thoughts (thoughts are equilavent to comments). It also includes creating and and deleting reactions to thoughts similar to "liking" a photo.
